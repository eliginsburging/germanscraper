Automated pipeline for scraping German flashcards for Anki

1. Install requirements.txt in a virtual environment
2. Put a list of single German words on newlines in a file called "toscrape.txt" in the same directory as getwords.py
3. run getwords.py in a terminal
4. follow prompts to select desired examples from Langenscheidt dictionary
5. the output file (examples.txt) can be uploaded into Anki to create two-field flashcards (use the import feature with | as the separator)
